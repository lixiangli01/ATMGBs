# ATMGBs

**ATMGBs** (Attention Maps and Graph convolutional networks for Binding site prediction) is a novel deep learning framework for sequence-based prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding sites. It integrates multiple feature types and leverages attention maps from protein language models to simulate spatial relationships between residues ‚Äî without requiring 3D structural information.

## üîç Overview

Protein-nucleic acid binding sites are vital for biological processes such as gene expression, replication, and transcription. While structure-based models have demonstrated strong performance, they rely heavily on the availability of high-quality 3D protein structures, which limits their scalability.

**ATMGBs** addresses this challenge by building a fully sequence-based model that approaches the performance of structure-based frameworks.
